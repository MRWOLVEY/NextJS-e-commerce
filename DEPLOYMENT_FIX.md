# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Fixed: âœ…

Your app was showing the Next.js boilerplate page because of middleware conflicts with next-intl.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Middleware Integration

- âœ… Integrated next-intl middleware properly
- âœ… Fixed locale routing conflicts
- âœ… Maintained auth protection logic

### 2. Production URL Configuration

- âœ… Updated all baseUrl references to work with Vercel
- âœ… Fixed SEO utilities for production
- âœ… Updated sitemap and robots.txt URLs

### 3. Vercel Configuration

- âœ… Updated vercel.json for proper routing
- âœ… Added production environment variables

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Commit & Push Changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues - integrate next-intl middleware"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel:

- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" or trigger new deployment
- Wait for build to complete

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional):

In Vercel dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` = `https://your-domain.vercel.app`

### 4. Domain Configuration (After Deployment):

Update your production environment file with actual domain:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app
```

## Why This Happened:

1. **Middleware Conflict**: Your custom middleware wasn't properly integrating with next-intl
2. **Missing Locale Handling**: next-intl needs its middleware to handle internationalization
3. **URL Configuration**: Production URLs weren't configured for Vercel environment

## Expected Result:

- âœ… Your custom homepage will now display correctly
- âœ… All pages will work with proper internationalization
- âœ… Auth protection will still function
- âœ… SEO and structured data will work in production

## Verification:

After redeployment, check:

- [ ] Homepage shows your custom content (not Next.js boilerplate)
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] Product pages load properly
- [ ] Language switching works
- [ ] Cart and auth flows function

Your app should now deploy correctly! ðŸš€
